# Motor_Direction_Control

1. You are given two AVR microcontrollers
AVR 1 and AVR 2
AVR 1 is connected to two push buttons PB_1, PB_2, and PB_3
AVR 2 is connected to an H-Bridge and a DC motor The two AVRs are also connected to each other.
You are required to:
a) Write a program that uses UART communication to achieve the following:
If PB_1 is pressed, then the motor turns clockwise
If PB_2 is pressed, then the motor turns the anti-clockwise
If PB_3 is pressed, then the motor turns off
b) Create a simulation of this circuit using any simulation program (such as proteus for example)
- Record a video of the simulation while it's running and press each push button to show their different actions in real time.
- Add this video to a zip or RAR folder with the rest of your answers.
